# polish-dictionary

Polish dictionary, with everyday automated build; as `.txt` plain file.

**Dictionary status:**

- [permalink to dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigo/polish-dictionary/master/dist/pl.txt) (always newest version),
- generation date: Wed, 26 Sep 2018 18:08:09 +0000,
- number of words: 4075569.

If there's no updates for a few days - it's normal. Just dictionary doesn't have any updates at this moment.


## For what?

Use it for whatever you need:

- prepare dictionary for applications you're using,
- prepare passwords list ðŸ˜Ž (just for educational purpose only, of course),
- use it in your words-game,
- waste ton of paper sheets by printing whole dictionary.


## Why?

Some time ago I've created [Polish dictionary for JetBrains IDEs](https://github.com/sigo/jetbrains-polish-dictionary). I'd like to update it automatically. Unfortunately I didn't found any automated Polish dictionary sources.

So... I just created it.

This repository doesn't have any connections with JetBrains or any other applications. It is just `.txt` dictionary.


## How?

Group of good people from <https://sjp.pl/> created and maintaining probably most up-to-date and valuable Polish dictionary in the world. However, they only provide [their work](https://sjp.pl/slownik/en/) as aspell, ispell and myspell dictionary packages.

Every day, this _library_, pull newest available aspell dictionary, dump it and push back to repository.
